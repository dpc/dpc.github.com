<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The biggest strength of Go, IMO, was the FAD created by the fact that it is
&ldquo;backed by Google&rdquo;. That gave Go immediate traction, and bootstrapped a
decently sized ecosystem. Everybody know about it, and have somewhat positive
attitude thinking &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simple, fast, and easy to learn&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I enjoy (Crude but still) static typing, compiling to native
code, and most of all: native-green thread, making Go quite productive for
server side code. I just had to get used to many workarounds for lack of
generics, remember about avoid all the <a href="https://gist.github.com/lavalamp/4bd23295a9f32706a48f">Go landmines</a> and ignore
poor expressiveness.</p>

<p>My favourite thing about Go, is that it produces static, native binaries.
Unlike software written in Python, getting software written in Go to actually
run is always painless.</p>

<p>However overall, Go is poorly designed language full of painful archaisms. It
ignores multiple great ideas from programming languages research and other PL
experiences.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12525949">&ldquo;Go&rsquo;s simplicity is syntactic. The complexity is in semantics and runtime
behavior.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Every time I write code in Go, I get the job done, but I feel deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>I think the best description of Go&rsquo;s problems was <a href="http://yager.io/programming/go.html">Why Go Is Not Good</a>.</p>

their lives and don’t want to try anything new. The language could be

<h2 id="more-on-my-experiences-with-go">More on my experiences with Go</h2>

<p>While I was following Go programming language since it&rsquo;s announcement and even
did some learning and toying with it, only recently I had opportunity to try Go
in real projects. For the last couple of months I&rsquo;ve been working a lot with
Go, and below is why I think Go is simply a bad programming language.</p>

<h3 id="nil">Nil</h3>

<p><code>nil</code>/<code>null</code> should not exists in any recent programming language.</p>

<p><code>nil</code> keeps being the biggest source of frustration when working with code
written in Go. <code>nil</code> handling is inconsistent too with sometimes <code>nil</code> being OK
to use, and sometimes not so much.</p>

<h3 id="no-sane-error-handling">No sane error handling</h3>

<pre><code class="language-go">o1, err := DoSomething1()
if err != nil {
    return
}
defer Cleanup(o1)

o2, err := o2.DoSomething2()
if err != nil {
    return
}
defer Cleanup2(o2)

…

oN, err := oN-1.DoSomethingN()
if err != nil {
    return
}
defer CleanupN(oN)
</code></pre>

<p>compare the above with corresponding Rust code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let o1 = try!(DoSomething1());
let o2 = try!(o1.DoSomething2());
…
let oN = try!(oN-1.DoSomethingN());
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">DoSomething1()
   .and_then(|o1| o1.DoSomething2())
   .and_then(|o2| o2.DoSomething2())
   …
   .and_then(|oN| oN.DoSomethingN())
</code></pre>

<p>You might ask, where are the cleanup calls. Well, because Rust has guaranteed,
predictable destructors, you don&rsquo;t need cleanup calls 99% of the time! Files
and sockets will be closed, http connections ended (or returned to the pool) etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go">Mildly-satisfying workarounds are given</a></p>

<h3 id="lack-of-generics">Lack of generics</h3>

<p>It seems to me lack of generic support is the root cause of all other problems.</p>

<p>Go has <code>nil</code> because without some form of generics, having a <code>Option</code> is not
possible.</p>

<p>Go has poor error handling, as something like Rust&rsquo;s <code>Result</code> can not be used
without generics.</p>

<p>Go has no proper collections, and you weird <code>make</code> invocations are required
because it lacks generics.</p>

<h3 id="annoyingness">Annoyingness</h3>

<p>I fiddle with the code to try something out, I get an error that something is
not used anymore. I have to remove the <code>import</code> to make the compiler happy.
Then add it again.</p>

<p>Why it can&rsquo;t be just a warning? Why is it <em>that</em> important for all the
<code>imports</code> to really be used?</p>

<p>Or compiler errors because <code>{</code> is on a newline. Madness.</p>

<p>Go compiler is happy when I don&rsquo;t check errors returned by a function (maybe by
mistake), and I have to use <code>go vet</code> and <code>golint</code> to ensure they are no real
issues, but it just won&rsquo;t let me be due to irrelevant details.</p>

<h3 id="small-things">Small things</h3>

<p>How do you decrement an atomic in Go?</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">AddUint32(&amp;x, ^uint32(c-1))
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s how. Easy to read, and self-explaining.
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/">https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/</a> . I mean&hellip; come on. It took similar time
to write the comment explaining how to decrement, as it would take to write a
much needed function that would just do it!</p>

<h3 id="community-doesn-t-like-me">Community doesn&rsquo;t like me</h3>

<p>Couple of times I ventured into Go community gathering places, looking for
advise on how to deal with some of the problems I was having. I don&rsquo;t know if
it&rsquo;s me, or the fact that I was referring to mechanisms from other languages,
that Go simply lacks, but every time I got rather hostile responses in tones of
&ldquo;one true way of Go&rdquo;.</p>
